# VanillaEnriched
A light, building focused modpack.

 

This modpack was made with the vanilla feel in mind, building on the core gameplay and adding things that don't ruin the original flow of the game.

Nothing OP that would take you out of the experience.

 

 

Included are the quintessential mods for any building project, such as Chisel, Bits; and the mandatory decorations: Decocraft, Bibliocraft, Mr Crayfish's furniture and more!

A huge variety of fauna and flora thanks to Pam's HarvestCraft, Wizard's Animals and Animania.

If you thirst for some exploration, there are plenty o' biomes to find, Serene Seasons and Camping!

Quality of life changes! Lots of them.
